nagivator is a daily planner app that makes it easier to do 2 things:

1. Identify what you should be next (oh you'll be reminded!)
2. Easily take in and process information (focus less on task management)

To this end, nagivator displays the upcomming time blocks for the day, starting
from right now til the end of your day.
